#    This script was created in order to calculate the strain      #
#    (X and Y directions) in 2D materials. To work, copy the       #
#    POTCAR and POSCAR files of the desired material in the        #
#    same directory as ./strain.sh/.                               #
#                                                                  #
#    How to run: nohup bash strain.sh > saida.out 2> job.err &     #
#                                                                  #
#    WARNING: If possible, install ssmtp via apt install before    #
#    runing the script!                                            #
